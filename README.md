# Price Recommendation for Online Sellers

## Project Overview

E-commerce platforms today are extensively driven by machine learning algorithms, encompassing tasks from quality checking and inventory management to sales demographics and product recommendations. One intriguing business use case in the e-commerce domain is to streamline and automate the process of providing price suggestions to sellers on online marketplaces. This project focuses on implementing a price recommendation system for online sellers using machine learning.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle using the following link: [Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saitosean/mercari). The dataset provides a valuable foundation for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

## Objectives

1. **Automate Price Suggestions:** Develop a machine learning model to automatically suggest prices for products listed by online sellers.

2. **Enhance Seller Efficiency:** Streamline the process of setting product prices, reducing the need for manual intervention.

3. **Improve Shopping Experience:** Contribute to the overall efficiency of the shopping website or app by ensuring competitive and optimal pricing.

## Project Structure

- **notebooks/:** Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- **data/:** Directory to store the dataset used for analysis.
- **results/:** Holds outputs, visualizations, and findings from the model.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration:** Analyze the features and distribution of the dataset to gain insights.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the data for model training.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Create relevant features that can enhance the predictive power of the model.

4. **Model Development:** Train machine learning models for price prediction based on historical data.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and fine-tune as needed.

## Conclusion
